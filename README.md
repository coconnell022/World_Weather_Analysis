# World_Weather_Analysis

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to collect and analyze data from cities worldwide and assist PlanMyTrip to make travel recommendations to their clients based on specific weather preferences. The initial analysis used Open Weather Map APIs and Google Maps APIs to perform an analysis on 2000 random coordinates to find cities nearby and their location, max temp, humidity, cloudiness, and wind speed. After the initial analysis, an additional request was made to add the weather description (clouds, clear skies, mist, etc.) for each city and to use input statements to filter data for specific preferences. This additional analysis will allow for 4 specific cities to be returned with a travel itinerary that contains driving routes, hotel names, and weather for each client preference.
